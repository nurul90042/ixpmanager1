Potential Todo / Feature Ideas
------------------------------

* IP address state (history and reserved) - see #274

* API - "another thing that could potentially be useful.. the way you
  generate RIR objects.. if members could generate their macro and maybe
  import/exports based on the data route servers receive this could be
  useful.. especially keeping import/exports up to date with a lot of
  peering is a major pain.."

* "the peer2peer stats page does not scale well for networks with many peers.
  I think it could be an idea to make it configurable if you want the
  actual graphs or just a list where you can select which graphs you would
  like to see in one view"

* <nick-2128> you know what would be incredibly useful? an ixpmanager.php
  file which bleated about whether the correct modules are installed or not

* Review MRTG script for reseller and fanout ports

* INEX require that members peer "with at least the greater of 4 other
  Members, or 10% of other Members". A tool to list members failing this
  requirement would be useful.

* Member audit - port states, errors / discards, route collector session
  status, route server session status, etc.

* Member health report

* Allow member to modify template that Request Peering email is populated
  with when sending invite using "Peering Manager". Ideally there could be a
  list of predefined variables available that could be used while templating
  email (ie. peer name, peer ASN, own name, own ASN, own WWW, common peering
  LAN IPs, AS MACRO, peering email, NOC email and so on), so member could
  create own template using above variables + own text.

  Also consider adding maxprefixes to peering manager template (see #174).


* Update suggested prefix limit / real prefix limit based on IRRDB entries?

* Add ASN to graph titles

* Multiple P2P graphs for LAG ports

* "hose that you have bilateral peerings with is the difference between the
  'Peers' tab and the 'Potential Bilateral Peers' tab. But I'll add a note
  to add a tab that also shows this."


* Maintenance Announcements / Diary  -was issue #30.
  * Page for upcoming scheduled maintenance
  * Select affected switches and generate a list of affected members (Name,
    ASN, IPv4, IPv6 addresses)
  * Add notification when members login, especially affected members, link
    to maintenance pages.

* Per location member statistics graphs to show all member traffic is a
  specific location - see issue #204

* An annual (or more frequent?) email to members reminding them of their
  subscriptions. Also email to custadmins reminding them of their users.
  Probably staggered over the year to prevent a flux of inbound emails.

* Single page view of all notes for a customer: https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/issues/273

* Billing details reorg - https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/issues/476

* Route Servers - PeeringDB never via route server
  * Never via route servers - https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/issues/610
  * BFD - https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/issues/351
  * Prefix aggregation - https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/issues/281
  * Update templates to use bgp_path.last instead of last_nonaggregated - https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/pull/692


* Patch Panel Updates:
    * Link port provisioning with patch panel information - https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/issues/660
    * Moving existing port doesn't update patch panel port record - https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/issues/661
    * Customer views shows MMR ODF with cabinet position for patch-panel demarc - https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/issues/535

*  Querying the signal level in optical modules - https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/issues/465
