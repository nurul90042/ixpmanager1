name: Feature request
about: Suggest an idea for this project

---

The ideal feature request comes with code via a pull request - after you have discussed the idea and approach with the developers via the mailing lists. This (or commercial support) is the most probable way to get a feature into IXP Manager! Feel free to file feature requests as an issue and tag it as such.

When evaluating pull requests or feature requests that would be developed by by the IXP Manager team, the question we ask ourselves is *would 80% of small to medium sized IXPs benefit from this?* If the answer is a clear yes then it's a valid and appropriate feature request that should be added to the list. If the answer is less clear or no, then do not assume it won't be accepted or developed - open a feature request and see what the community thinks about it. 

Those feature requests that we are unlikely to implement through the open source program or those that do not align with the core purpose of IXP Manager may be closed or moved to [a feature request file](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/blob/master/IDEAS) so as not to clog up the issue tracker.
