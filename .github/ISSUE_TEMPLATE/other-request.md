## "Support, Out in the Open"

INEX promotes a "Support, out in the open" model. When support issues crop up, we invite people to send them to the mailing list where a member of the community can answer them. When this model is used, search engines pick up relevant query terms, everybody learns about the application and the developers can see what's important to the community. This allows all members of the community to benefit.

INEX doesn't offer free private technical support. This means that if you email one of the development team directly, we will politely suggest that you send your question to the mailing list or use a commercial support channel.
