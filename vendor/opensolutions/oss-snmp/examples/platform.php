OSS_SNMP - A PHP SNMP library for people who hate SNMP MIBs and OIDs!
Copyright (c) 2012, Open Source Solutions Limited, Dublin, Ireland
All rights reserved.

See: https://github.com/opensolutions/OSS_SNMP/

This is an example script to show how to use OSS_SNMP. It requires two arguments:

 - the IP address of hostname of a SNMP capable host
 - the SNMP v2 community string for that host

For example:

    {$argv[0]} 192.168.10.20 public


HELPTEXT;

    exit( 1 );
}

require_once( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/../OSS_SNMP/SNMP.php' );

$host = new \OSS_SNMP\SNMP( $argv[1], $argv[2] );

echo "\n\nPlatform details for {$argv[1]}:\n"
    . "\nVendor:     " . $host->getPlatform()->getVendor()
    . "\nModel:      " . $host->getPlatform()->getModel()
    . "\nOS:         " . $host->getPlatform()->getOs()
    . "\nOS Version: " . $host->getPlatform()->getOsVersion();

echo "\n\n";

exit( 0 );
